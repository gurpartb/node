{
"Template Literal": "A way to concatenate strings in JavaScript(ES6). Easier to work with than a bunch of strings concatenated with + ",

"Syntactic Sugar": "A feature that only changes how you type something, but nothing changes under the hood. It's important to understand what is happening under the hood, so we don't make decisions based on flawed assumptions.",

"Asynchronous": "More than one process running simultaneously. Node does things acynchronously. V8 does not.",

"Synchronous": "One process at a time. JavaScript is synchronous. Think of it as only one line of code executing at a time. NodeJS is asynchronous.",

"Callback": "A function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point. The function -calls back- invoking the function you give it when it is done doing its work.",

"Non-Blocking": "Doing other things without stopping your programming from running. This is made possible by Node's doing things asynchronously.",

"Buffer": "A Temprorary holding spot fro data being moved from one place to another. Intentionally limited to size.",

"Stream": "A sequence of data made available over time. Pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole.",

"Binary Data": "Data stored in Binary (sets of 1s and 0s). The core of the math that computers are based on. Each one or zero is called a 'bit' or 'binary digit'.",

"Character Set": "Representation of Characters as numbers. Each character gets a number. Unicode and ASCII are character sets.",

"Character Encoding": "How characters are stored in Binary. The numbers (or code points) are converted and stored in binary.",

"Byte": "8 Bits. 00101100"'
